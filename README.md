# game-of-21
A Java program written in Honors Programming class as a high school sophomore. GUI- and console-based card game.

A clone of the classic Game of 21, complete with fictitious wagering.
The game is played in the console; a separate window pops up to display the cards (see GameOf21.png).
Uses TurtleGraphics, a package of graphical tools supplied by the programming class instructor.
